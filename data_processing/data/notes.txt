test cases:

* get_ratings.py
    * store ratings correctly in db if db option is on 
    * return array of ratings if db option is off
    * return an error if user does not exist


timing on local machine:
* 100k samples: 8 seconds
* 200k samples: 14 seconds
* 250k samples: 18 seconds
* 300k samples: 22 seconds
* 400k samples: 27 seconds
* 500k samples: 33 seconds

should probably explicitly set random seed on surprise functions (it's in the docs) so that recs are the same each time a user runs it
